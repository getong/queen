"""
The binary push body: an alternative to the JSON body of POST /api/v1/push.

    "QPB1" | u8 flags | [u32 raw_len, when zstd] | body
    body:  u32 groups | per group: u16 len, queue | u16 len, partition | u32 n
           | n x ([u16 len, transactionId, when flag 4] | u32 len, payload)

All integers little-endian. flags: 1 = the body is one zstd frame of raw_len
bytes, 2 = answer with the counts only, 4 = every item carries its transaction
id (empty = the broker mints it). No trace id. Each payload is one JSON
document.

With flag 8 (encode_push_frames) a group is the messages as the broker stores
them, compressed here once:

    body:  u32 groups | per group: u16 len, queue | u16 len, partition | u32 n | u32 z_len | z
    z:     one zstd frame of n frames: u32 body_len | u8 0 | u8[16] message id
           | u16 len, transactionId | payload

The message id is a version-7 UUID minted by the client; a message without its
own transaction id uses the id's text. The broker checks every frame and keeps
the compressed bytes as they are, so it does not compress them again.

A broker that does not know this body answers 400; a client sends it only when
``binary_push`` is set, so by default a push is the JSON request every broker
knows.

The binary transaction body (encode_transaction_frames), an alternative to the
JSON body of POST /api/v1/transaction, carries the pushes the same way:

    "QTB1" | u8 flags | u32 len, head | u32 groups | the groups, as with flag 8 above

head is the JSON transaction body without its push operations: the acks in
``operations``, ``requiredLeases``, ``kv``, ``timers``. flags: 2 = the answer
leaves out the pushes' and the acks' results and counts them (``pushed``,
``duplicate``, ``acked``); the riders' results stay. In the answer the head's
operations come first and the groups' messages after them, in the order
written; the riders follow, as in the JSON body.
